# Historical versions of homemade_yes
On January 12th, 2026, I accidentally leaked personal info on the original homemade_yes repository, so I had to make it private and create a new one with its own history.

As a side effect, old versions of homemade_yes became unavailable for public use, so I'm archiving them here instead. Each minor version has its own branch with a reconstruction of what the source code tree looked like at that time.

Please do not propose new features here; instead, make an issue at `PPPDUD/homemade_yes`, where actively-maintained versions are kept.
